## Code Quality: Progressing
* welp. Why 2 app.js? when working with code you're not using I would leave it out of production. You can also put unused code in another branch for the future reference. 

## Technical requirements: Performing
Got some good js fundamentals here. 
* More ES6 syntax!

## Creativity and Interface: Performing
I like your attention to detail, the font, the rounded corners it makes it playful for the type of game that it is. 
* not responsive but still looks good on mobile. I would've liked your buttons change for mobile. 

## Presentation: Progressing 
* It would be good to see what your schedule was in your repo
* what were some errors you ran into, how you solved them
* features that you created
* any sources you used would be good here


## Additional Feedback
There's a slight glitch. When I make my last move of the sequence it immediately fires the next sequence. Another setTimeout would be good to give it a slight pause
* I challenge you to pick something new that we haven't learned in class to add to your projects.
