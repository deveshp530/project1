Approach:
When I first thought out how to build the game, I thought it was going to be a piece of cake. Later did I realize how wrong I was. The first step that i needed to get done was to make each circle flash. Once that happened I can start working on the rest. THe next step was to take the user input of them clicking the circles and matching them with simon. And if they matched, simon would add another circle to the sequence to make it harder as the user guesses correctly.
